In the Star Wars galaxy, the kilogram, or kg, measures mass.  We know, for instance, that a B1 battle droid tips the scales at 65 kilograms. This unit of measurement appears throughout the saga, from the High Republic era to the sequel trilogy and beyond, showing up in various books, comics, and even episodes of *The Mandalorian*.
