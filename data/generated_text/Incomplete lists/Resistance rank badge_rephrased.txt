The Resistance, fighting against the First Order, used distinctive rank badges.  These gray rectangles sported red markings for army officers and blue for navy.  General Leia Organa, however, notably wore a rank-free vest.  Resistance command officers donned brown uniforms featuring repurposed Rebel starbirds, while medical personnel wore darker uniforms with armbands.  Ground logistics staff sported faded-yellow jackets, with junior and lead dispatchers in modified officer uniforms.  These badges and uniforms appeared throughout the Resistance's struggle, as seen in various films, comics, and novels.
