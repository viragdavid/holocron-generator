In 22 BBY, a light-skinned human named Eos Morne was spotted at Coruscant's exclusive Outlander Club.  Brown-haired and brown-eyed, Morne gained unexpected fame before *Attack of the Clones* even premiered â€“  he introduced a behind-the-scenes video, appearing in full costume.  His brief appearance in the film itself cemented his place in Star Wars lore.
