A shadowy K'Jtari pirate, whose name remains unknown, left a lasting mark on the Star Wars galaxy.  In 0 ABY, this pirate taught Sana Starros a deadly neck strike.  Starros later used this move to subdue the escaping archaeologist Doctor Aphra while transporting her for the Rebel Alliance.  The encounter, recounted by both Starros to Princess Leia and Aphra in a posthumous recording, highlights the pirate's unexpected influence on a pivotal moment in the galaxy's history. This pirate's legacy, however fleeting, is immortalized in the pages of Marvel's Star Wars comics and Doctor Aphra's story.
