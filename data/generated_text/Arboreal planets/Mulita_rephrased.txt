Deep within Wild Space lies Mulita, a forested planet teeming with the Drengir, sentient carnivorous plants.  This is their homeworld, ruled by the Great Progenitor, the first Drengir.  An ancient Amaxine transport pod system, intended to combat the Drengir, backfired, inadvertently allowing the creatures to infiltrate an Amaxine space station.  Later, during the High Republic era, Jedi Knights Dez Rydan and Reath Silas discovered Mulita while investigating this station, narrowly escaping with their lives after encountering the Drengir.  The planet's connection to a spreading Drengir infestation across the galaxy led Jedi Master Avar Kriss to launch a major assault on Mulita, a strategic move known to the Nihil, who exploited the Jedi's absence to attack elsewhere.  Mulita's story, first hinted at in "Into the Dark," was later fully revealed in various High Republic books and comics, solidifying its place as a pivotal location in the conflict.
