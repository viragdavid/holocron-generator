During the Clone Wars, a Separatist droid factory on Mokivj prompted a mission led by Anakin Skywalker.  While investigating, Anakin encountered Grand Admiral Thrawn – then a Commander, strategically downplaying his rank – aboard his ship.  This encounter, set on Batuu in 19 BBY, occurred concurrently with the Mokivj operation and followed the Lioaoin skirmish on Moraband.  The story unfolds across several appearances in the Thrawn Ascendancy series.
