In the year 0 ABY,  the Imperial-aligned worlds gathered for a crucial diplomatic conclave on Phelarion, hosted by the formidable Thalassa Tarkin.  Among the attendees, secretly disguised as "Lerna," was Princess Leia Organa herself. The lavish banquet was dramatically disrupted by an exploding patch of megonite moss, casting a shadow over this already tense meeting amidst the Galactic Civil War.  Key figures included Darth Vader, and other powerful leaders like Shea Hublin and Qua Mzerc. This event, sandwiched between missions to Tatooine and the subsequent devastation of Rion, proved a pivotal moment in the ongoing conflict.
