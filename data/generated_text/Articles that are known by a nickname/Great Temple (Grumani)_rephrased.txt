Deep beneath Sarrassia's Mount Diligence, hidden by an underground lake, lay the Grumani Great Temple.  Built after the Great Hyperspace War, this seemingly pious structure, dedicated to the Grumani deities, secretly guarded the Helm of Ieldis â€“ a powerful Sith artifact.  But its sanctuary was short-lived.  Around 1039 BBY, the Helm was spirited away to Skarpos to evade the Sith Lord Odion.  Then, in 1032 BBY, during the Sarrassian invasion, the temple met a fiery end.  Priestess Zoojoo detonated a hidden bomb, collapsing the temple and sacrificing herself to ensure the artifact's ultimate hiding place remained a secret.
