In the Mid Rim's Herdessa sector, lies the planet Cificap VIII.  Shortly after the Rebel victory at Yavin, a daring raid near this world liberated Habassa slaves from the clutches of the Empire, preventing their transport on the starship *Mayhem*.  This action, recorded in *Star Wars: X-Wing Tour of Duty: B-Wing*, highlights the Rebel Alliance's commitment to freedom, even in the far reaches of the galaxy.
