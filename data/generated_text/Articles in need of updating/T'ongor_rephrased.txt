T'ongor, a dark-skinned human male bounty hunter and twin brother of T'onga, found himself caught in a deadly web of betrayal.  Working alongside Nakano Lash and other notorious hunters like Boba Fett and Bossk, he participated in a mission to attack an Unbroken Clan sanctuary on Corellia, a job orchestrated by the Mourner's Wail Syndicate heir, Khamus.  However, Lash's true motives were revenge, and she killed Khamus.  T'ongor, realizing the mission's failure and Lash's treachery, alerted the other bounty hunters, initiating a chaotic escape.  During the getaway, Boba Fett attempted to eliminate Lash, but a shot intended for the Nautolan instead fatally struck T'ongor. Years later, his sister T'onga, unaware of the true circumstances, sought revenge against Lash for his death, eventually learning the truth and forging a new path. T'ongor, known for his red clothing, white gauntlets with advanced comms jamming technology, and close bond with his twin, left a lasting impact on the galaxy's criminal underworld, ultimately shaping his sister's destiny.
