Sandstone, a common building material in the Star Wars galaxy, played a significant role in iconic structures.  Hosnian Prime's breathtaking hanging gardens were nestled within a colossal sandstone pyramid.  On Jedha, ancient sandstone buildings, including four majestic Jedi statues, stood as testament to the planet's rich history.  Even everyday objects, like tables, were crafted from this versatile stone.  Sandstone's presence is seen throughout various Star Wars stories, from the High Republic era to the events of *Rogue One*.
