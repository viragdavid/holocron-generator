Title: Unidentified k'Jtari pirate
Main: A pirate was part of the k'Jtari group. By 0 ABY , the pirate taught the human smuggler Sana Starros a hand-to-hand combat technique that consisted of using an arm to hit an individual on the back of their neck. While Starros was transporting a prisoner of the Rebel Alliance —the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra —to the Alliance's Sunspot Prison aboard her ship that year , she used the technique the pirate had taught her to incapacitate Aphra as she tried to escape. The smuggler then informed rebel Princess Leia Organa , who she was traveling with, that she had learned the move from the pirate. Later that year, Aphra created a recording for Starros that she intended the smuggler to hear after her death . During the recording, the archaeologist recounted a number of events in her life, including when Starros had performed the technique to stop her from escaping and the smuggler's mention of the K'Jtari pirate who had taught her it.
Behind the scenes: The k'Jtari pirate was first mentioned in the sixteenth issue of the 2015 comic series Star Wars . The issue was written by Jason Aaron and published by Marvel Comics on February 17 , 2016 .
