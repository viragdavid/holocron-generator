Title: Mulita
Main: Mulita was a forest planet located in the Mulita system , deep within Wild Space in grid square H-19 of the Standard Galactic Grid . It was the homeworld of the sentient carnivorous plants known as the Drengir and the haven of the Great Progenitor , the first of the Drengir. The Amaxine warriors constructed a transport pod relay on the planet , connected to a space station , intending to defeat the Drengir and take the planet. The Amaxines were unsuccessful, and the Drengir utilized their relay to send a number of their people to the Amaxine space station . The Drengir on the station were eventually imprisoned on the station by the Sith , and those remaining on the planet were unaware of their fate. During the High Republic Era , the Jedi Knight Dez Rydan was transported to the Drengir planet while investigating the Amaxine station, as was the Jedi Padawan Reath Silas some time later. Having received two visitors from the relay system, the Drengir deduced that the station remained intact. Silas and Rydan escaped the planet in one of the two pods shortly afterward, but were followed by several Drengir in the other. When the Drengir pod arrived on the station, Silas used the Force to push it backward, sending the pod back into hyperspace and killing the Drengir that had emerged. Several months into the Drengir's infestation of the Galactic Frontier , the Jedi Knight Keeve Trennis managed to locate the Great Progenitor through a connection to the Drengir. Suspecting Mulita's nature as the rootworld of the Drengir, Jedi Master Avar Kriss summoned a number of Jedi to assault the world during the time of the Republic Fair on the planet Valo . Nihil Tempest Runner Pan Eyta was aware of the situation, and was confident that neither the Jedi Order or Galactic Republic would be able to respond to the marauders' attack on Valo due to the Jedi being occupied on Mulita.
Behind the scenes: Mulita first appeared, albeit unnamed, in the novel The High Republic: Into the Dark by Claudia Gray , published on February 2 , 2021 . It was later mentioned, and named, several months later in Cavan Scott 's novel The High Republic: The Rising Storm , released on June 29 , where its name was misspelled as "Miluta". The proper spelling was given when the Mulita system was first mentioned in the sixth issue of the Star Wars: The High Republic comic book , also written by Scott. However, the planet's correct spelling was not confirmed until the comic's eighth issue .
