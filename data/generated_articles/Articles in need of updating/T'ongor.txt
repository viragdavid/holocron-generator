Title: T'ongor
Main: T'ongor was a human male bounty hunter and the twin brother of T'onga . He was one of several bounty hunters hired by Khamus of the Mourner's Wail Syndicate as part of a team led by Nakano Lash , whose mission was to attack a sanctuary of the Unbroken Clan on the planet Corellia . During the mission, Lash killed Khamus as revenge for the murder of his target, and T'ongor contacted the other hunters , warning them of Lash's betrayal and the mission's failure. As they made their escape, Boba Fett attempted to kill Lash for her betrayal, but due to the intervention of Lash's protégé Beilert Valance , T'ongor was instead killed. Years later, T'onga swore to avenge his death by hunting down Lash.
Life as a hunter: Born as the twin brother of T'onga , T'ongor and his sister worked as bounty hunters in the galaxy . The siblings were associates of the Nautolan hunter Nakano Lash as well as the Abednedo technician Jhorstek . Around 10 BBY , the four criminals shared a drink in Phelar Port on the planet Eriadu when a young thief was apprehended by stormtroopers . Although Lash wanted to help the boy, Jhorstek and T'ongor decided against it, not wanting to cause trouble. The group looked on as the ex- Imperial soldier Beilert Valance rose to defend the boy and attack the troopers . When Valance was shot down, Lash came to his aid, causing T'ongor and the others to assist the wounded hunter.
A job with Nakano Lash: Sometime later, T'ongor was part of a team led by Lash, who had been hired by Khamus , heir of the Mourner's Wail Syndicate . Before the job, the hunters gathered on Lash's starship , the Starskimmer . T'ongor contacted his twin sister via a long-range communicator hologram and asked her to join them for one last mission before T'onga settled down with her betrothed, Losha Tarkon . T'ongor told his sister that he was happy for her and disconnected, allowing Valance to use the communicator before the team was briefed by Lash. Khamus paid the bounty hunters to attack a sanctuary of the rival Unbroken Clan on the planet Corellia in order to get him close to his target. T'ongor accompanied Lash and Khamus while fellow hunters Valance, Bossk , and Boba Fett eliminated the Unbroken Clan's guards. When one of the sentries escaped Bossk, Khamus began to complain about the quality of the bounty hunters' work, but T'ongor jammed the escaped sentry's comms, preventing him from warning the rest of the Unbroken Clan. Lash killed the sentry, and she, T'ongor, and Khamus entered the Unbroken Clan facility once the other hunters had killed the remaining guards. Upon learning the identity of Khamus' target, Lash attempted to stop him. Khamus killed the target, and was shot dead by Lash in revenge. T'ongor was shocked by Lash's murder of their client, and contacted the other hunters about her apparent betrayal, insisting that they escape before facing the consequences of Khamus' death. T'ongor fled alongside Lash and the young girl Cadeliah , the child of Khamus and the Unbroken Clan woman Krynthia , who was also now the heir to both syndicates. As they ran, Lash reassured him that if he trusted her, they could escape together. After being informed by T'ongor of Lash's actions, Fett attempted to kill the Nautolan, but Valance's intervention caused his shot to miss Lash and instead hit T'ongor, immediately killing him. Despite T'ongor's death and the mission's failure, the other hunters managed to escape. Lash would ultimately go into hiding with Cadeliah.
Legacy: T'onga, unaware of the truth behind her brother's death, blamed it on Lash and swore to kill her. When Lash eventually resurfaced in 3 ABY , T'onga returned to her former life of bounty hunting in order to get revenge on her for the death of T'ongor and the loss of their family's honor. When Lash resurfaced and became the target of many bounty hunters, T'onga joined forces with Valance and eventually located Lash on Ruusan . There, Lash told T'onga that she had not been the one to kill T'ongor, but that he had been shot from an elevated position while they were trying to escape. Although T'onga was initially prepared to once again leave her life of bounty hunting behind once she had learned the truth, she later formed her own crew . During a battle, in her thoughts of death, T'ongor appeared to her in a hallucination, which reminded T'onga of what Lash said about the young girl Cadeliah , who could unite the warring criminal syndicates, ending the bloodshed that caused her brother's death. She later formed a new crew in an effort to locate the girl, making T'ongor's death mean something.
Personality and traits: T'ongor was a human male with black hair and brown eyes and dark skin. He and T'onga were born to a culture that felt a special bond between twins. At the time of the job with Nakano Lash's crew, T'ongor did not have a romantic partner, although he was happy for his sister when she decided to settle down with her betrothed Losha Tarkon , who T'ongor approved of, noting that his sister-in-law possessed "strong bloodlines."
Equipment: T'ongor wore red clothing and white gauntlets , which contained both a wrist comm and technology that could jam another individual's communications. During the job on Corellia, T'ongor carried a brown satchel on his left shoulder.
Behind the scenes: T'ongor appeared in a flashback sequence in Bounty Hunters 1 , a comic written by Ethan Sacks , illustrated by Paolo Villanelli , and published by Marvel Comics on March 11 , 2020 .
