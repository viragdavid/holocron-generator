Title: Mission to Batuu
Main: During the Clone Wars , Senator Padmé Amidala received as message from one of her handmaidens , Duja . Duja reported that Separatists were on Mokivj and had a droid factory in place. Padmé would go on to investigate, but her husband , Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker would go in to find out what went wrong. Anakin would later meet a mysterious ship underneath the command of Chiss Senior Captain Mitth'raw'nuruodo , also known by his core name of "Thrawn." When Thrawn met Skywalker, he introduced himself as a commander instead of a Senior Captain. His pilot , the sky-walker Che'ri , reasoned that using the lower rank was less intimidating.
